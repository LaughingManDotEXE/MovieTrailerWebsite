Udacity FSND Project 1: Movie Trailer Site

Description: This is my first project "Movie Trailer Website" for Udacity Full
Stack nanodegree. I based my theme on Overwatch, with characters representing
posters and animated shorts instead of trailers.
This project is to demonstrate how to create a Movie Review website.

Files: media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py. plus images.

Software to Install: Python and Python IDLE is needed, head over to python.org
to download. 
How to run: Run entertainment_center.py in python IDLE to execute.
fresh_tomatoes.py is provided from Udacity, and has an additional class .nopadding due to layout issues. 

References: .nopadding is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19562903/remove-padding-from-columns-in-bootstrap-3
